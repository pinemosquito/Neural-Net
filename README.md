I started to poke at Keras which is a high-level neural networks library, written in Python.  I used Keras with Tensorflow in the backend.
First, let import the Sequential model type from Keras.  This is simply a linear stack of neural network layers.

    from keras.model import Sequential
    from keras.model import Dense, Dropout, Activation
